Venezuela, once the most prosperous country of Latin America is now languishing in violence, sickness and hunger. Venezuelans are dying of simple infection for lack of the most basic antibiotics. Their currency is worthless and their stores are empty. Dictator Nicolas Maduro, his family and cohorts, are living like royalty in the fashion of Assad, Qaddafi, and similar despots; while their countrymen are literally starving and beaten into submission. The Maduro regime provides passports for terrorists. Venezuela has the largest oil deposit in the world.

This bill would not specifically include the infamous \"bump stock\" used in the Las Vegas shooting. \r\n1. The language in question can be misconstrued to include many parts of a semi-auto firearm, such as binary triggers, match grade triggers, tuned triggers, heavy recoil springs or buffers.\r\n2. Criminals do not follow laws. \r\n3. The shooter is the only true determination of the rate of fire in a semi-auto. Even with a bump stock, you are not guaranteed a faster rate of fire, as it is shooter dependent, and still one shot per pull of the trigger. \r\n4. This is an ambiguous infringement on the 2nd amendment.\r\nFrom: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3999",

It violates the 1st Amendment by making sites liable for their users' actions. This prevents expression &amp; restricts what a site can do overall. Forums have been shut down, marketplaces have been shut down, and service options continue to experience limitations. As a result, legal workers had their businesses majorly affected &amp; threatened to be shut down as a result of these new policies, and the illegal workers are being pushed further underground and in MORE danger as a result. Punishing law-abiding citizens with hopes that a small number of law-breakers might be caught is wrong. PLEASE SIGN! REPEAL SESTA/FOSTA!",
